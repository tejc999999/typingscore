# WEB system for typing performance management
Character image (src / main / resources / img / charactor.png) of the grade display screen can be used without application for Japanese Tohoku companies only.
In case of use by other companies, it is necessary to replace the image.  
Since the notice image (src / main / resouces / img / sign.png) on the ranking display screen draws Japanese directly in the image, it does not correspond to the multilingual environment

## environment
* framework: SpringBoot
* language: java, html, css, javascript(datatables, ajax)
* DB: IBM Cloudant or H2 database(No persistence)(If environment variable VCAP_SERVICES is not set, it operates in h2 database)
